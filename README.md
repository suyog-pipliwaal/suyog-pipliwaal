## About Me

Hello there! I'm Suyog Pipliwal, a passionate and curious individual with a strong background in Machine learning and Computer Science. Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant at Queen Mary University of London, where I actively contribute to cutting-edge projects in the realm of NLP, human-computer intersection and cognitive science.

My journey in AI began during my undergraduate studies, where I was captivated by the immense potential of it  to transform the way we live and work. As a Research Assistant, I have had the privilege of working with leading experts in the field, collaborating on exciting research endeavors that address challenges in dialouge systems, human-computer intersection, Multimodal machine learning algorithms etc.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on  to explore novel ideas and push the boundaries of MultiModel learning algorithms
- 👯 I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and supporting the community. I actively participate in machine learning Machine learning hackathons. 

When I'm not immersed in research and coding, you can find me playing DOTA2 or lifting weights. I find that these activities not only provide balance but also fuel my creativity and problem-solving abilities in my work.

## Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects you'll find in my repositories:

1. **Machinehack Hackathon**: I take parts in hackathons on [Machine Hack](https://machinehack.com).This repo contains the solution for all the competition I have taken part.
